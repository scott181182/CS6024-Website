# Data Visualization Design Critique

In 2020, the scientific publication [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) partnered with the YouTube channel [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt) to make a video about the world's CO2 emissions (shown below). All of the data and research used in that video was then provided as a write up in Our World in Data[^1], which is the subject of this review.

## Purpose

The purpose of this report and accompanying visualizations is to provide some visibility into the production of CO2, the primary driver of global climate change. To support this purpose, the article breaks down CO2 generation into a number of visualizations, including **Global CO2 emission from fossil fuels**, **Per capita CO2 emissions**, and **Decoupling CO2 emissions from economic growth**.
